# Amazon-Sales-Global-Dashboard
Project Overview : Successfully created Amazon Sales Global Dashboard with the help of Power BI tool. Extracting actionable insights and trends, I transformed raw data into visually compelling reports and dashboards. This project not only honed my skills in data analysis but also deepened my understanding of the e-commerce landscape.


Key Achievements : Implemented advanced Power BI functionalities for in-depth analysis.Developed dynamic and interactive dashboards, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions. Identified key sales trends, customer behaviors, and product performance indicators.


Technical Skills Demonstrated : Power BI | Data Analysis | Data Visualization | DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) | Query Editor | ETL (Extract, Transform, Load).


Here's what I've learned :

Power Query : Used for extracting, transforming, and loading data into Power BI. I learnt how it helps in data cleaning, modelling and merging.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) : It helps in calculations and aggregations. In this, I made use of SQL statements with "IF THEN" logic.
Formatting : Crafting a presentable dashboard requires attention to detail and a basic knowledge of colour systems.
Data Visualisation : Utilising various charts like slicers, maps, graphs and the Top N filter.
Dynamic Data : As and when data changes, numbers require cross-checking and overall the numbers should make sense.
